  background: "Due to the airing of urgent special news bulletins regarding the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcano eruption on January 15, 2022, the previous series that was occupying the same time slot required a scheduling adjustment. Thus, Kawaii dake ja Nai Shikimori-san's own TV broadcast premiere was delayed by one week from April 2, 2022 to April 9, 2022. The series was released on Blu-ray and DVD in six volumes from June 29, 2022 to November 30, 2022.",
